pigs barge into our home every day
us living in peace they cannot stand
the message is clear we want to send 
opportunity's now for us to say

end this oppression we must go out and fight now
better future for new generations
its the path to liberation

throw the brick for your freedom
fuck these pigs we dont fear them
the streets calling you to join us
our time is coming
throw the brick for your freedom
fuck these pigs we dont fear them
the streets calling you to join us
our time is coming its coming 
now

our resentment is brewing, it's gonna blow
again the sherrif comes to stop our show
our community's tired of "moral" tyrrany
politely asking is over now we demand

to end this oppression we must go out and fight now
better future for new generations
its the path to liberation

throw the brick for your freedom
fuck these pigs we dont fear them
the streets calling you to join us
our time is coming
throw the brick for your freedom
fuck these pigs we dont fear them
the streets calling you to join us
our time is coming its coming 
now

fight fight in the street 
our colors are not a secret to keep
show our pride
for their comfort we will not lie
for their comfort we will not lie
for their comfort we will not lie
for their comfort we will not lie
for their comfort we will not lie
for their comfort we will not lie
for their comfort we will not lie
for their comfort we will not lie
for their comfort we will not lie
