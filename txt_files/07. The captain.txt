The army refuses me
Glory they can't guaranty
Chemicals increased my size
The whole world will see me rise
Secret mission to save the troopers
Killed a few of Hydras abusers
Red scull revealed his face
My rage he will embrace

With the shield by my side
I will rise like a tide
With the fire in my eyes
Trough the storm and the skies (everybody dies)

I am your hero
Trapped in absolute zero
To get this love off my chest
All my strength I'll need to manifest
Saved the world of disaster
Listen now to your master
Stuck in ice for 70 years
Now I have no more fears

With the shield by my side
I will rise like a tide
With the fire in my eyes
Trough the storm and the skies (everybody dies)

With the shield by my side
I will rise like a tide
With the fire in my eyes
Trough the storm and the skies (everybody dies)
