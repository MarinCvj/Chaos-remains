Fire, burns, in the skies
Fire, reflects, in my eyes
Chaos, unleashed, their peace was a lie
Chaos, remains, my people will die

See my end falling from the sky
See the might of fire
Scream for help, everyone responds
No one comes, you liars/cowards

Help me now, help me shine the light
Their awfull crimes, can't go on
Don’t you cry, for my soul tonight
In this hell, I fight on 

Fear, awaiting, their return
Fear, impedes, on every turn
Death, whispers, in my ear
Death, release, from the torture here

See my end falling from the sky
See the might of fire
Scream for help, everyone responds
No one comes, you liars/cowards

Help me now, help me shine the light
Their awfull crimes, can't go on
Don’t you cry, for my soul tonight
In this hell, I fight on 

And so my fall I see, even though I fought eternally

See my end falling from the sky
See the might of fire
Scream for help, everyone responds
No one comes, you liars/cowards

Help me now, help me shine the light
Their awfull crimes, can't go on
Don’t you cry, for my soul tonight
In this hell, I fight on
