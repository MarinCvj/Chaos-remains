UUAA

They stole my heart, so I built mine
Trapped in this cave, just like a slave
Deceived them, with my mind
Made a machine, they burn to death

Fly, burn, drop dead
Fly, ruin, kill, the end

I work alone, then I am betrayed
Stane took my hart, motherfucker I have two
I am overpowered, but he died
He made me, bloody Iron Man

Fly, burn, drop dead
Fly, ruin, kill, the end

I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once

Fly, burn, drop dead
Fly, kill, ruin, the end
