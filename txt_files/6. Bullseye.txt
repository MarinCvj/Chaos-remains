Fire, burns, inside my eyes
Hell, awaits, for my return
Welcome, to, eternal pain
Sickening, awakening, will shower with death

Sing, sing free tonight
High, high in the sky
Sing, sing my melody
High, high to remedy

Death, whispers, in my ear
Seek, the enemy, punish and destroy
From my will, to your kill, let them fear my skill
Shoot, the enemy, a great monstrosity

Sing, sing free tonight
High, high in the sky
Sing, sing my melody
High, high to remedy

Sing, sing free tonight
High, high in the sky
Sing, sing my melody
High, high to remedy

Sing, sing free tonight
High, high in the sky
Sing, sing my melody
High, high to remedy
