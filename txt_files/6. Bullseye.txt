In the circus, I am an assistant, to the mighty Swardsman
Knowledge of Trick Shot, the master archer, made me the greatest marksman 
Everybody left me, look at what it made me, I will hit, the bullseye 
Everybodies treason, gave me a reason, to become Hawkeye

Scorched desire, made my fire, burning brighter, I am a fighter 
Destoryed mind, formed my pride, assemble brothers, lets kill the suckers

Hey, hey, hey hey

The greatest assassin, makes them froze in, blows in, goes in for the kill
Collective empire, collision with fire, filled my quiver with some silver
Ronin is my name, let me see your pain, born to lose, lived to win 
There is only one hell, the one we live in now

Scorched desire, made my fire, burning brighter, I am a fighter 
Destoryed mind, formed my pride, assemble brothers, lets kill the suckers

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Scorched desire, made my fire, burning brighter, I am a fighter 
Destoryed mind, formed my pride, assemble brothers, lets kill the suckers
