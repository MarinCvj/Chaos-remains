Lost, my will, to live
My thunder, lost its, storm
My friends, now are gone
Brother where are, you

Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
Killed you god butcher
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
I have Titans head
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
The Accursed did shit
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
Stopped puny god Loki
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
Surtur crushed Hella down
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
Asgard went to dust

Lost, in the space
wondering why, they took it all from me
I beat, them all, I don’t know why
did it all matter

Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
Elves stabbed my mother
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
Sisters curse broke Odin
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
Hellas mind was crushed
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
The warriors three none
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
Titan snapped Lokis neck
Fight, Fight, Fight, Fight!
Heimdall bravely fell down

Lost, in the space
wondering why, they took it all from me
I beat, them all, I don’t know why,
did it all matter

I raised, Love, at my best
Taught her how to fight
Taught her how to bleed
I, am growing old
Knowing, I am fucked
