Stolen form my father
In the name of Odin
Loved by mother Freya
And worshiped by Thor

I failed you mother
I failed you father
In the jaws of death
I laugh at Him

The Hawk bewitched by me
Destroyed the pity of Earth
The Mad Titans army struck
The Earth in fear of death

I failed you mother
I failed you father
In the jaws of death
I laugh at Him

My vicious mind failed me
Betrayed by my brother
Joined by Earths keepers
Banished me in endless agony

I failed you mother
I failed you father
In the jaws of death
I laugh at Him
