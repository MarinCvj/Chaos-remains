You barge into our home every day
Us living in peace you cannot stand
Slowly getting obvious everyone can say
You’re crossing the line written in the sand

End this oppression we must go out and fight now
Better future for new generations
Its the path to liberation

Throw the brick for your freedom
Fuck these pigs we dont fear them
The streets calling you to join us
Our time is coming 
Now

Our resentment is brewing, it's gonna blow
A new night you come in to stop our show
Our community's tired of your tyrrany
We fight now so we can live

End this oppression we must go out and fight now
Better future for new generations
It’s the path to liberation

Throw the brick for your freedom
Fuck these pigs we dont fear them
The streets calling you to join us
Our time is coming 
Now

Fight fight fight in the street 
Our colors are not a secret to keep keep
Show our pride
For your comfort we will not lie
