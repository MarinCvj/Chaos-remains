Arising, the beast
Hit by, the rays
Ross wants, a weapon
Betty, suffers

The beast awakens, kills you now
I will rule, don’t stand in my way
The green thing is, feared by gods
Don’t come near, the mighty phoenix

Blonsky, and my blood
Created, Abomitation
Tearing down, the city
I go, to fight

The beast awakens, kills you now
I will rule, don’t stand in my way
The green thing is, feared by gods
Don’t come near, the mighty phoenix

Crushed by Leviathan
