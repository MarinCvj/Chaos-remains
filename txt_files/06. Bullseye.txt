Fire, burns, inside my eyes
Fire, burns, for my rise
Hell, awaits, my return
Hell, awaits, to see me burn

Don’t you cry, for my sole tonight
Don’t you cry, this eternal night
Help me now, help me find the light
Help me now, in this blackest white

Death, whispers, in my ear
Death, whispers, why are you here
The end, is near, don’t your fear
The end, is near,(you are) my final kill

Don’t you cry, for my sole tonight
Don’t you cry, this eternal night
Help me now, help me find the light
Help me now, in this blackest white

And so my fall I see, even though I fought eternally

Don’t you cry, for my sole tonight
Don’t you cry, this eternal night
Help me now, help me find the light
Help me now, in this blackest white
