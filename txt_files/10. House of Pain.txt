House of pain
1.circle = Limbo

Abandon all hope who enter here
Charon the ferryman may steer
Sinners fall down to His will
Innocent fall down the same hill

Lucifer awaits
Minos decides your fates
House of pain
House of pain

House of pain

To save the sole of Beatrice
Judgement we must resist
Minos chooses their abyss
So confess all of your sins

Lucifer awaits
Minos decides your fates
House of pain

Lucifer awaits
Minos decides your fates
