Collecting the warriors, to build some memorials, 
to be glorious, to become victorious
Lokies imprisonment, awoke his judgement, 
we became puzzlement, awoke the monster
Lokies dominion, over the millions, 
broke their opinion, suffer will millions

They will be destroyed into the void
They will be destroyed into the void
They will be destroyed into the void
Into the void, into the void

He will not shame us, neither will he take us,
nor will not break us, he will not claim us
Blood, sweat, tears and pain, 
it will be in vain if we donâ€™t kill the raid
Hulks smashing and dashing, Thors mighty crashing,
Chitauri with fury bashing, destruction seeking

They will be destroyed into the void
They will be destroyed into the void
They will be destroyed into the void
Into the void, into the void
