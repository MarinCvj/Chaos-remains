In my youth I pay the price
The red room covers my eyes
My whole life was a lie
Now I swear I'll kill the demon

Black widow in the night
Black spider to the fight
Mind control with his ring
Mind breakdown to the thing

Broke my dad out from prison
Night, night to your treason
Master plan in the making
Blood spilling and remaking

Black widow in the night
Black spider to the fight
Mind control with his ring
Mind breakdown to the thing

Taskmasters plan to kill
Created by his will
It fell down like his lie
Now you see me fly

Black widow in the night
Black spider to the fight
Mind control with his ring
Mind breakdown to the thing
