Collecting the warriors, to build some memorials, 
to be glorious, to become victorious
Lokies dominion, over the millions, 
broke their opinion, suffer will millions

They will be destroyed into the void
They will be destroyed into the void
Into the void, into the void
They will be destroyed into the void

He will not shame us, neither will he take us,
nor will not break us, he will not claim us
Blood, sweat, tears and pain, 
it will be in vain if we donâ€™t kill the raid

They will be destroyed into the void
They will be destroyed into the void
Into the void, into the void
They will be destroyed into the void

Death will die, I will live
Death will die, I will live
Death will die, I will kill
Death will die, I will kill

They will be destroyed into the void
They will be destroyed into the void
Into the void, into the void
They will be destroyed into the void
