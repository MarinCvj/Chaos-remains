Murder own blood for earthly riches
Brothers torn apart by quest for power
Neck deep in ice as cold as your heart
Bow your heads from winds of kokytos

(Caina)
Traitor to family 
(Antenora)
Backstabbing your own kin
(Ptolomaea)
Guests you put on a spike
(Judecca)
Son of God for a price 


(Rat) Treachery against your people
(Eat) The prison guard that kept you starving 
(Horror) Gruesomeness that leaves no pity
(Deep) Frozen to your head

Politics you abused
Loyalty's a foreign word to you
Corruption deep within your soul
Failed the duty to your people 

(Lie) on your back submerged to your face
(Soul) Still living but already sentenced
(Kill) The victim you yourself invited
(Cold) blooded murder case

Tears freeze over your eyes
Cold just as you were to unsuspecting
Guests falling for your lies
Decieve when they were least expecting 

(Caina)
Traitor to family
(Antenora)
Backstabbing your own kin
(Ptolomaea)
Guests you put on a spike
(Judecca)
Son of God for a price 

(Stuck) Head to toe completely frozen
(Pose) Unmoving in this lake of torture 
(Wind) The only sound in barren wasteland 
(Sin) The deepest of them all

Kiss to send our Lord to death
Pleb, you should really know your fucking
Place, the Lord rules over all
Gave Him up now you can't feel his warmth

(Caina)
Traitor to family
(Antenora)
Backstabbing your own kin
(Ptolomaea)
Guests you put on a spike
(Judecca)
Son of God for a price 


His banners now I see
The king of Lords judgment
Trapped in the frozen sea
The final punishment 

Vexilla regis 
prodeunt inferni
Captivus in glacie
Poena ultima

(Caina)
(Antenora)
(Ptolomaea)
(Judecca)

Great figure in the fog
Dis, Lucifer or Satan in the
Flesh, it's wings create the winds
Heads, chewing on the greatest sinners

(Brutus) Ceasar was your great protector 
(Cassius) Assassin for some personal honour
(Judas) betrayed the Son, our Lord and saviour 
(Pain) deserved forever more

Climbing down the beast, our journey's over
Suddenly we turn we've passed through earth's core
Inferno lies beneath us, paradise ahead now
Purgatory waits, our way to heaven

(Caina)
Traitor to family
(Antenora)
Backstabbing your own kin
(Ptolomaea)
Guests you put on a spike
(Judecca)
Son of God for a price
