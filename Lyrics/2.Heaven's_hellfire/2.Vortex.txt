Vortex
2. Circle = Lust

Mighty hurricane appears in the sky
All winds gather to hear their cry

Lustful minds imprisoned down below
All for their sins created long ago

Release me of this pain, crawling inside me
Unleash my wrath for her, her soul to be free
These lives fall, like falling rain
Only agony found in this spirit hurricane

A man lost a brother in the swirl of sin
Woman wrongs another, no one wins

Lustful minds imprisoned down below
All for their sins created long ago

Release me of this pain, crawling inside me
Unleash my wrath for her, her soul to be free
These lives fall, like falling rain
Only agony found in this spirit hurricane

Release me of this pain, crawling inside me
Unleash my wrath for her, her soul to be free
These lives fall, like falling rain
Only agony found in this spirit hurricane
