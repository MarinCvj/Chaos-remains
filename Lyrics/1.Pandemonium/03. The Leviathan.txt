Arising, the beast
Hit by, the rays
Ross wants, a weapon
Betty, suffers

The beast awakens, kills you now
I will rule, don’t stand in my way
The green thing is, feared by the gods
Don’t come near, the mighty phoenix

Blonsky, and my blood
Created, Abomination
Tearing down, the city
I go, to fight

The beast awakens, kills you now
I will rule, don’t stand in my way
The green thing is, feared by the gods
Don’t come near, the mighty phoenix

Crushed by Leviathan
